# UnrealJolt

![Physics](Resources/Screenshots/play.gif)

## Overview
A fork of [UnrealJolt](https://github.com/Yadhu-S/UnrealJolt) by [Yadhu-S](https://github.com/Yadhu-S) bringing [Jolt Physics](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics) into Unreal Engine 5.

This fork is focused on refactoring large parts of UnrealJolt to fit it for general-purpose use. Expect this fork to be more experimental, and less stable than the upstream UnrealJolt. 

If stability is a priority, use the original. Fixes and improvements are upstreamed back to UnrealJolt via PRs where possible.

## Getting Started

### Some things to consider before using this

- This is a bolt on integration and not a replacement for the existing chaos physics solver.
- You should only need this if you specifically want some kind of behaviour that's not available in chaos.
- Deterministic physics, multicore processing of many bodies could make the case.
- Multicore processing it not yet implemented properly using Unreal's own thread pool system. 
- The implementation of this plugin while is generic (somewhat), is still tied to something I am developing on the side. Just keep in mind that all features of UE might not be integrated, you might have to do it yourself. (Drop a PR if you do :) )
- There are possibilities of breaking changes, until 1.0.0 at least. (will try to avoid)

### Requirements

- Unreal engine 5.7.4 (Might work on older versions)

### Installation

- Clone (`git clone --recursive git@github.com:Yadhu-S/UnrealJolt.git`) or download into the `Plugins` folder (`<project>/Plugins or Engine/Plugins`)
- Take a look inside `UnrealJoltLibrary.Build.cs` to see the user defines, modify what you need, or leave defaults. Check the available defines [ here ]( https://jrouwe.github.io/JoltPhysicsDocs/5.3.0/md__build__r_e_a_d_m_e.html )
- Compile project
- Make sure UnrealJolt is enabled in "Plugins"
- Use actor-tag and tag dynamic objects with `jolt-dynamic` (make sure that the object is movable) and static objects with `jolt-static` 

### Configuration

![Config](Resources/Screenshots/SS_Config.png)

- Plugins->Jolt in your project settings.
- Check the defaults, and change if required.
- Debug rendering is slow, especially when visualizing large heightmaps. Drawing all those triangles. (Need to look into drawing triangles only once for
  static objects )

## Features

### UJoltSkeletalMeshComponent
- UJoltSkeletalMeshComponent extends USkeletalMeshComponent to add jolt specific functionality (Browse JoltSkeletalMeshComponent.h to see the available functions)
- Modify the physics asset as required through the editor
  - ![SkelMeshAdj](Resources/Screenshots/SS_UjoltSkeletalMesh.png)
  - Compound shapes are also supported
- Adjust the options as required 
  - ![Options](Resources/Screenshots/SS_SkelMeshOpt.png)
  - Adjust the "Visual Offset" to align the visual mesh with the physics body

### Heightmaps 

 ![Landscape](Resources/Screenshots/SS_Landscape.png)

- **Landscapes** and **LandscapeSplines** are cooked automatically when you **Play in Editor**.  
  - This may be a chore if you work with many levels, playing a level at least one time in editor (will work on it).  
- A `JoltData` directory is always generated during cooking and **must be included when packaging your project**.

## Collision Layers

Configured under **Project Settings → Plugins → Jolt → Layers**.

- Add/remove **Broadphase Layers** and **Object Layers** using the array widgets.
- For each Object Layer, pick its **Broadphase Layer** from the dropdown.
- Toggle which layer pairs collide in the **Collision Matrix**.
- `Static` and `Dynamic` are required and cannot be deleted.

## Deterministic simulation

To ensure deterministic simulation with Jolt Physics across platforms, follow the [official guidelines](https://jrouwe.github.io/JoltPhysicsDocs/5.3.0/index.html#deterministic-simulation). Use Jolt’s math and utility functions (`Sin`, `Cos`, `QuickSort`, `BinaryHeapPush/Pop`, `Hash`) instead of STL or platform-dependent ones, and always keep API calls (body/constraint creation, updates) in the same order.
